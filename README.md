# PTYNet
This repository includes official PyTorch implementation of the paper "Free Fine-tuning: A Plug-and-Play Watermarking Scheme for Deep Neural Networks". (ACM Multimedia 2023 Poster) \[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07809)\]

## Get Started

We recommend using [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) for installation.

## Dataset

We provide the dataset and models for Fixed Background (SimpleBG). The dataset can be downloaded [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/12eCegBKTnYQ13rAPzt32Wg?pwd=gnzq) and the corresponding model checkpoint is [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1gPDMxzcki70oXLX3w6jriw?pwd=wemh).

```sh
conda create -n ptynet python=3.7
conda activate ptynet
```
After activating conda environment, please install the dependencies running the following commands

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Our models and datasets will be available soon.
